        The Alchemist tells the story of Santiago, a young shepherd from Spain who dreams of finding treasure near the
        pyramids of Egypt. Encouraged by a mysterious king, he sells his flock and begins a journey filled with
        challenges, omens, and lessons. Along the way, he meets a crystal merchant, an Englishman seeking alchemy, and
        finally an alchemist who guides him to listen to his heart and trust the “Language of the World.”

        Santiago discovers that the real treasure is not gold or riches, but the wisdom gained from following one’s
        dreams and understanding that true fulfillment comes from pursuing one’s Personal Legend—one’s destiny in life.
        In the end, he learns that what he was seeking had always been closer than he thought, but the journey was
        essential for him to grow and transform.
